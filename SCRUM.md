# 📋 SCRUM Plan – Diabetes Prediction App

This file documents the simplified Scrum-based planning structure for the **Diabetes Prediction App**, developed in one day with AI support (ChatGPT). Although it was a solo project, it has been retroactively organized into sprints to demonstrate familiarity with Agile/Scrum practices.

## 🧩 Sprint Breakdown

### 🟦 Sprint 1 – Project Setup & Dataset
- Defined the project objective: Predict diabetes based on health metrics
- Selected and reviewed the dataset (`diabetes.csv`)
- Performed basic data cleaning and feature selection

### 🟨 Sprint 2 – Model Training
- Chose `Logistic Regression` model (from `scikit-learn`)
- Trained the model inside `model.py`
- Evaluated performance and tested predictions

### 🟥 Sprint 3 – Web App & Deployment
- Designed the Streamlit interface in `app.py`
- Connected user input to model prediction
- Deployed the application using **Streamlit Cloud**
- Wrote documentation (README & SCRUM.md)
